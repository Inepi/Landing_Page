# Landing_Page

This was the second project of The Odin Project's curriculum, which had us create a landing page similar to the example they provided
completely from scratch. It was pretty fun to use what I had learned so far to try to design something, and the page ended up looking
better than I expected. It was somewhat daunting to start from scratch, but I felt pretty comfortable putting together something
as I started working. I also started to become a bit frustrated with my level of understanding of certain code elements; I attempted
to simplify/condense certain sections of the CSS to reduce redudancy, but I still feel like if I redid the project in the future,
I could do more with less. The project also gave me good experiences on how flex boxes work relative to each other, which will
definitely be built on, and come in handy in the future.
